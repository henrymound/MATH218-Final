```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)

```

## Setup
First we will load in our data set and clean it. 
```{r cars}
clinical_spectrum <- read_csv('clinical_spectrum/clinical-spectrum.csv')
clinical_spectrum_filtered <- clinical_spectrum[,c(1:39)]
clinical_spectrum_filtered <- clinical_spectrum_filtered[,-c(21, 28)]
clinical_spectrum_clean <- clinical_spectrum_filtered %>%
  na.omit()
# Now, let's convert test result to binary
clinical_spectrum_clean <- clinical_spectrum_clean %>%
  mutate(test_result = ifelse(
    clinical_spectrum_clean$sars_cov_2_exam_result == 'negative',
    'A',
    'B'))

# Now, let's do the same so we can plot
clinical_spectrum_cleanPlot <- clinical_spectrum_clean %>%
  mutate(test_result = ifelse(
    clinical_spectrum_clean$sars_cov_2_exam_result == 'negative',
    'Blue',
    'Red'))
# 1. Plot
plotData <- as.data.frame(
  clinical_spectrum_cleanPlot[, c("test_result", "platelets", "hematocrit")])
plot( plotData[ , c(2, 3) ],
     col=plotData[ ,1 ])
```

## LDA

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
